# 🛠️ Play Integrity Fix - v69 (2025-07-12)

## Changelog

- ✅ **Improved Compatibility**  
  Enhanced support for the latest Play Integrity API changes rolled out with Google Play Services v24.27.x. Devices previously marked as “MEETS_BASIC” should now report “MEETS_STRONG” status.

- 🔐 **SafetyNet & Play Integrity Layer Hardening**  
  Updated response spoofing and signature masking logic to better avoid detection by enhanced integrity checks introduced in Android 14 QPR3 and newer.

- 🧩 **Module Initialization Fixes**  
  Fixed rare race condition during early boot on some devices (especially Pixel 7/8 series), which could cause inconsistent module behavior.

- 🚀 **Optimized Performance**  
  Reduced overhead by streamlining system property hooks — module is now lighter and boots faster on most configurations.

- 🌐 **Better ROM Support**  
  Improved compatibility with custom ROMs like LineageOS 21, Pixel Experience, and GrapheneOS. Especially useful for users who rely on microG or de-Googled builds.

- 🧪 **Experimental: Enhanced Emulator Detection Bypass** *(opt-in)*  
  Early support for bypassing integrity checks on emulators (for testing/development purposes only). Disabled by default — enable via `system.prop`.


## 🔄 Why Update?

This version brings **critical improvements** to maintain compatibility with evolving Play Integrity and SafetyNet checks.  
If you've noticed apps like Google Wallet, banking apps, or streaming services failing to verify device integrity, this update is highly recommended.
